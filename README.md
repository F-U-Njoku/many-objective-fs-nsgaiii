# Explainable multi-objective feature selection with NSGA-II
In this repository, you will find the codebase for the experiments of our proposed multi-objective feature selection with NSGA-II.
The four files represent the various experiments we executed:
* Baseline  &rarr; baseline.py
* Two objective &rarr; nb_nsga.py
* Three objectives &rarr; nb_nsga_3.py
* Four objectives &rarr; nb_nsga_4.py
