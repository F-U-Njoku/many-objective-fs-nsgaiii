# On the interpretability of Many-Objective Feature selection (MOFS)
In this repository, you will find the codebase for the experiments which we used to test our proposed methodology for solving the interpretability short fall of (MOFS).
The four files represent the various experiments we executed:
* Embedded SOFS (RF)  &rarr; baseline.py
* Two objective &rarr; nb_nsga.py
* Three objectives &rarr; nb_nsga_3.py
* Four objectives &rarr; nb_nsga_4.py
